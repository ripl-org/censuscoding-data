## Build Steps

This tool uses the [scons](https://scons.org/) build system. The sequence of
build steps and intermediary files are described in the included
[SConstruct](https://github.com/ripl-org/censuscoding-data/blob/main/SConstruct) file.

First, install the python (>=3.10) build dependencies with:

    pip install numpy pandas pyshp rtree scipy scons shapely usaddress zenodo-get

Next, install the R (>=4.2) plotting dependencies with:

    Rscript -e 'install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggplot2", "viridis", "ggsci", "gridExtra"), repos = c("https://cran.r-project.org"))'

Finally, run the `scons` command from the root directory to start the build.
You can instead use `scons -n` for a dry run or `scons -jN` to run on *N*
concurrent processors.
